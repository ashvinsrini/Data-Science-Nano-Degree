AirBNB Seattle data set was chosen because this data set is so rich and all has the necessary details about home stays  in the city of Seattle. In data exploration perspective, we could address and lot of business questions and back our findings with the aid of data. And also we could build a predictive model to predict the reviewers rating. 

The files in this repo are: 
1) listings.csv: It includes full descriptions and average review score 
2) Reviews.csv: It includes unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
3) Calender.csv: It includes listing id and the price and availability for that day


Observations: 
We found that houses, apartments are the most common types of properties listed on AirBNB Seattle city. 
And neighbourhoods like Capitol Hill, Arbor heights have some of the best review ratings. While neighbourhoods like Alki, Fairmount Park are among the more expensive neighbourhoods
